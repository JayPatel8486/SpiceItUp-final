              Indo-Chinese is a cuisine in itself and hugely popular back home
              in India. It’s the Indian version of Chinese and as you can
              imagine has lot of vegetarian options and lots of spices too. In
              fact it’s so popular that we have a Indo-Chinese restaurant here
              in Seattle too! I grew up loving Indo-Chinese, I actually thought
              this is how Chinese food was supposed to be. It was only when I
              went to college in Scotland and tasted some real Chinese food I
              realized how wrong I was!.

              pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of
              bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano,
              tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other
              ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using
              a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served
              hot.Italy has many variations of pizza. The Neapolitan pizza, or
              Naples-style pizza, is made specifically with buffalo mozzarella
              Roman pizza often omits tomatoes (an early 16th-century import)
              and uses onions and olives.
